# Scaling the species abundance distributon

The universality of SAD patterns might be due to processes that produce a Fisher logseries always being relevant at small scale but not at large scale

to test:
  1. confirm fisher at small scale
  2. describe how aggregation works to prevent fisher from upscaling
  3. fit birth-death-immigration model at small scale
  4. show that the BDI process changes with upscaling
