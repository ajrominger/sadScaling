# Scaling the species abundance distributon

*Evaluating how different biological and statistical processes affect the SAD at different scales*

The universality of SAD patterns might be due to processes that produce a Fisher logseries always being relevant at small scale but not at large scale.  To test this we are:

    1. using a large collection of small-scale SAD data to confirm the universality of the Fisher logseries at those small scales
    2. using a smaller number of very large plots to evaluate the scaling of SAD shapes (using best practices implemented in [`pika`](https://github.com/ajrominger/pika))
    3. fitting birth-death-immigration models to SAD data across scales
